              <h3>Why choose us?</h3>
              <p><b>Experience:</b> We bring a wealth of industry experience. We’ve put in the hard yards so you don’t have to. Our work on our own side projects means we’re probably working through the same challenges as you. We get it.</p>
              <p><b>Value for money:</b> We operate in a deliberately lean way. We keep our cost model low and we pass on these savings. We’re big on delivery and low in price.</p>
              <p><B>Flexibility:</b> We tailor our approach to suit budget and need. We are a for-profit company but open to reduced rates, deferred payment, equity arrangements, and any approach that delivers on your goals and our vision. </p>
              <p><b>Co-design:</b> Design is a noisy, collaborative exercise which thrives on diversity of thought. We are big on collaboration, shared understanding and two-way skills transfer. We’re actively non-proprietary.</p>
